# My Power BI Portfolio
Collection of my data analytics projects.

## Projects

### 1. [NHL Player Analysis](NHL_Analysis/)
A dynamic player card dashboard analyzing 700+ NHL skaters using API data.

### 2. [NHL Baseline Expectation Engine (Predictive)](NHL_Baseline_Engine/)
**Tech:** Python (Scikit-Learn), Power BI, Machine Learning, Variance Analysis
*Advanced continuation of Project 1.*
This project introduces a Linear Regression model to predict player goal totals based on historical metrics. It compares live API data against these predictions to identify contract inefficiencies (Breakout Stars vs. Regression Risks).
